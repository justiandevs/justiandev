## Why I built my portfolio
I built my portfolio for school and to present myself to potential clients. I also built my portfolio because I wanted to get to know markdown and the options it offers in combination with nextjs to build a blog, for example.

### What I did for the project
For my entire project, I actually did everything myself. I first started by creating the design in Figma and then converted it to code using the NextJS framework and the Tailwind CSS framework. After this, I deployed it at Vercel and made it accessible to everyone.
