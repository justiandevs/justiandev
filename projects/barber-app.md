## Why I built the Barber App
I had to build the hairdresser app for school. The core of the assignment was to create an application through which you could make an appointment as a customer with the hairdresser. I did this assignment together with four others of which two were working on the backend and three on the frontend/devops.

### What I did for the project
For the Barber App I did backend but also a bit of frontend. I used NextJS to create the frontend and we used Laravel together with a few beautiful spatie packages to create the backend.
